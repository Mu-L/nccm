# Servers configuration file in YAML format.
#
# This connections (servers) file is loaded from the following paths,
#   in the following order - whichever is found first:
#
#   ~/.config/nccm/nccm.yml
#   ~/.nccm.yml
#   ~/nccm.yml
#   /etc/nccm.yml
#
# Use the following format:
#   FRIENDLY_NAME:
#     user: USER_NAME
#     address: SERVER_ADDRESS
#     comment: FREETEXT_COMMENT
#     keepalive: KEEPALIVE_TIME
#     identity: IDENTITY_FILE
#     customargs: CUSTOM_ARGS
#
#   Details:
#       FRIENDLY_NAME - Can be any freetext descriptive name or user@server:
#         (mandatory field).
#       USER_NAME - Your login name (optional field).
#       SERVER_ADDRESS - Hostname or IP address (optional field).
#       FREETEXT_COMMENT - Any freetext you like to store as a comment on
#         this connection (optional field).
#       KEEPALIVE_TIME - Override the default nccm_config_keepalive with
#         this value (optional field).
#         Value is in seconds. Use 0 to disable sending keepalive messages
#         for this connection.
#       IDENTITY_FILE - Override the default nccm_config_identity with
#         this path (optional field).
#       CUSTOM_ARGS - Any custom arguments you want to send to ssh that
#         are not currently supported in nccm. These will be appended to
#         the end of the ssh command at connection time.
#
# You can also supply FRIENDLY_NAME as user@server:   if you don't want to
#   supply any of the details fields as follows (don't indent):
#   root@10.10.1.1:
#   user@example2.com:
#
# In this case user name and address will be extracted from friendly name
#   automatically.
#
# Once you're done editing this file, verify it as follows:
#   yamllint nccm.yaml
#
# The "code lines" (those that actually carry the config) must adhere
#   to the yaml structure (proper indentation, etc).
#   A mistake here is wrong and will probably cause nccm to give an
#   error message.
#   yamllint is also very fussy about line lengths (80 chars max),
#   comment indents, no blank lines at the end of the file, etc.
#   These are less important and nccm handles them ok, but best to stick
#   to the yaml structure and keep yamllint happy...


# nccm internal configs:

nccm_config_controlmode: std    # Supported values: std, focus
nccm_config_loglevel: warning
# ^ Supported values: debug, info, warning, error, critical
nccm_config_keepalive: 30
# ^ Send keepalive every n seconds (0 to disable) to prevent disconnection
nccm_config_identity: false
# ^ For public key authentication, normally ssh will load your private key
#   from the default locations. You can force ssh to use your own file by
#   putting it's path here. Or set to false to let ssh do it's own thing.


# connections configs:

Another server:
  address: 10.2.2.2
  comment: this is another comment
  user: foo

# Here's a comment and empty lines are ignored

border router:                # Comments are allowed here
  comment: My border router   # And here
  address: 192.168.1.1        # And everywhere else
  user: admin                 # Settings order is not important
  # This comment is indented like the code
  keepalive: 40
  # ^ Override the default nccm_config_keepalive with this
  #   on a per-connection basis.
  identity: /home/user/mykey
  # ^ Override the default nccm_config_identity with this
  #   on a per-connection basis.
  customargs: -v -C           # Your own custom args to ssh

test server:
  address: test.example.com
  user: root

root@10.10.1.1:
root@10.10.2.2:   # Note how nothing else is supplied...

user@example2.com:
  comment: Comment supplied, user/server extracted from FriendlyName

# The final line of yaml must have content. yamllint will complain if you
#   leave empty lines at the bottom.
